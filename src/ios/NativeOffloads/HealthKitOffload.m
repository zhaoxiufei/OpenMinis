// reported `ok:true` + no data for every metric, and the agent concluded the
// user had no health data — or that permission had been revoked — and told
// them so. Reads now get the same error treatment writes already had via
// isHealthKitAuthError/saveWithAuthRetry.
//

// cannot reintroduce the bug by copy-paste: there is no error-dropping variant
