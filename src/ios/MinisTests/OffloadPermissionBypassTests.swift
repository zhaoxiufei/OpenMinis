///
/// `native_offload_lookup()` → `offload_find()` matches the BASENAME of argv[0]
/// (`strrchr(guest_path, '/')`, deps/ish/kernel/native_offload.c:186-196).
/// `extractOffloadCommand` compared the raw first token, so
/// `/usr/local/bin/apple-calendar` matched nothing, returned nil, and the
/// caller — which reads nil as "not an offload command" — ran it with no
/// prompt. The kernel dispatched it anyway. Absolute-path spellings therefore
/// reached HomeKit / Photos / Location regardless of the
/// configured level, including Not Allowed.
///
/// These tests pin BOTH directions: every spelling of a registered command is
/// recognised, and nothing else becomes one by accident — a basename rule
/// applied carelessly could match `/opt/evil/apple-photos`, which is correct
/// (the kernel would dispatch that too), but must not match unrelated commands
/// that merely live in a similar path.
