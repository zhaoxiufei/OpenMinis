// MARK: - Speech player control (read-replies TTS)
//
// A floating audio-player-style control for the "Read replies" TTS, with two
// states like the voice-input panel:
//   • expand  — a capsule showing the TTS model (tappable to switch), a speed
//               chip, a pause/resume button, and a close (×) button.
//   • compact — a small circular speaker button.
// Lifecycle:
//   - Enabling read-replies opens it EXPANDED.
//   - When the first reply utterance actually starts speaking → collapse to
//     compact.
//   - Tapping the compact button → expand.
//   - 15s of no interaction while expanded → collapse to compact.
//   - In expand mode the capsule can be DRAGGED to reposition; tapping any empty
//     area outside it collapses to compact (the tap-catcher lives in AIChatView,
//     driven by `vm.speechPlayerExpanded`).
