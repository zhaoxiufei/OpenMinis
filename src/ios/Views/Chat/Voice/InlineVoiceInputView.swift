// [T-voice-scroll-gesture-priority] Shared mechanism for Conflicts I + H.
//
// The panel's outer `.highPriorityGesture(DragGesture(minimumDistance: 18))` sits
// on the OUTERMOST container, so it outranks any inner ScrollView's pan and used
// to hijack every vertical drag > 18pt — the user could never actually scroll a
// long transcript in EITHER mode: dragging to read simply collapsed the panel
// (or exited editing).
//
// The fix needs one reliable signal — "can this transcript still scroll in the
// direction the finger is moving?" — consulted by the panel gesture before it
// acts. SwiftUI's ScrollView exposes no offset on our deployment target (the app
// ships iOS 16.0, so iOS 17/18 ScrollPosition APIs are out), so we read it from
// UIKit: a zero-size probe planted inside the ScrollView walks up to the real
// UIScrollView backing it and observes contentOffset/contentSize/bounds.
//
// This deliberately does NOT rewrite the transcript editor as a
// UIViewRepresentable (the spec floated that): the editing branch is a
// `TextField(axis: .vertical)` whose focus/keyboard lifecycle we have just
// stabilised across several fixes (T-voice-panel-gap-after-edit). Swapping it for
// a custom UITextView would put all of that at risk for no added signal — the
// probe below yields the same contentOffset/contentSize facts without touching
// the editor.

/// [T-voice-scroll-gesture-priority] Attaches the panel's collapse/expand/
/// exit-edit drag at a priority that depends on the transcript's scroll state.
///
/// SwiftUI cannot change a gesture's priority in place, so the two cases are
/// distinct modifiers applied by a branch:
///   • `absorbedByScroll` — the transcript still has scrolling to do in this
///     region, so attach with `.gesture` (DEFAULT priority). The inner
///     ScrollView's pan outranks it and the content scrolls normally; the panel
///     stays put.
///   • otherwise — attach with `.highPriorityGesture`, the original behaviour, so
///     the panel reliably claims the drag (necessary because a bouncing
///     ScrollView holds onto the touch even at its boundary, and a default-
///     priority parent would never fire).
///
/// The branch changes the gesture's identity, so SwiftUI tears the old recognizer
/// down and installs the new one.
///
/// [T-voice-edit-gesture-exclusive] EDIT MODE INSTALLS NO PANEL GESTURE AT ALL.
/// When `isEditing` is true this modifier attaches nothing, so the transcript
/// TextField's own native gestures (caret placement, selection, internal scroll)
/// are the ONLY thing recognizing touches — there is no panel drag to arbitrate
/// with, race, or suppress. This replaces the earlier approach of keeping the
/// drag installed and rejecting its synthetic/mid-touch callbacks
/// (`panelDragInFlight`): the user asked for true mutual exclusion in edit mode,
/// not a per-trigger patch. Removing the recognizer is exclusion at the source —
/// the edit-entry double-tap can no longer flip the gesture's identity mid-touch
/// (the recognizer isn't there), and no in-edit drag can reach the panel.
///
/// Exit-edit is NOT lost: it moves to the transcript editor's own swipe-down
/// (see the editing branch in transcriptArea), which is a gesture ON the text
/// area, consistent with "only the text box's gestures respond while editing."
