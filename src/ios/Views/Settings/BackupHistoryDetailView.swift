/// A self-restarting "in progress" indicator for a history row.
///
/// [T-ios-backup-running-spinner-stops] A bare `ProgressView()` in this row
/// stopped animating after the row had been scrolled off screen and back a few
/// times, leaving a running backup looking idle. A Form/List re-realises its
/// rows on scroll rather than reusing them UIKit-style, and an indeterminate
/// `ProgressView`'s animation is owned by the platform view it wraps — when the
/// row is torn down and rebuilt, the rebuilt one can come back with its
/// animation not running. Nothing in the row's own state changes at that point,
/// so nothing ever kicks it back into motion.
///
/// [T-ios-backup-spinner-accelerates] The first fix for that drove a
/// `repeatForever` rotation from an `@State` flag, flipped false→true in
/// `onAppear` and back in `onDisappear`. It restarted reliably, but it SPED UP:
/// scroll the row off and back and it turned about twice as fast, then three
/// times, gaining a little each cycle.
///
/// The cause is that a `repeatForever` animation is attached by the state
/// change, not owned by the view. `onAppear` for the re-realised row can run
/// before `onDisappear` for the outgoing one, so each cycle attached ANOTHER
/// infinite rotation to the same `rotationEffect` while the previous one was
/// still live. Concurrent rotations on one effect sum, so the observed speed
/// was a count of how many were still running — and `onDisappear` setting the
/// flag back to false could not cancel an animation that a different instance
/// had started.
///
/// So the angle is now COMPUTED from the current time instead of animated
/// towards: `TimelineView(.animation)` re-evaluates each frame and the
/// rotation is a pure function of the timestamp. There is no animation object
/// to duplicate, cancel, or leave running, which makes both the original
/// stall and the acceleration unrepresentable rather than merely handled.
/// Deriving from an absolute clock also means a row that scrolls back into
/// view picks up at the phase it would have been at, instead of jumping back
/// to zero. The view exists only while `status == .running`, so completed and
/// failed rows still pay nothing.
