# Build rclone as a static library for iOS and package it as an XCFramework.
#
# Produces deps/frameworks/Rclone.xcframework with two slices:
#   ios-arm64            (device)
#   ios-arm64-simulator  (simulator)
#
# The simulator slice matters: libish_emu.a is device-only, which already
# prevents building this app for the Simulator. rclone must not become a
# SECOND reason — if the iSH constraint is ever lifted, this should not be
# what blocks it.
#
# Which backends get linked is decided by deps/rclone-mobile/backends/backends.go,
# not here. rclone itself is a go.mod dependency (pinned version), never
# vendored — upgrading is a one-line change to that file.
